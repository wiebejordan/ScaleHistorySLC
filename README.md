In less than three weeks, I developed a fully responsive website from the ground up to allow players to register for tabletop wargaming events, chat with teammates and view their armies. 

- After registering for the website, players can register for events, after which they will receive an email with in depth event information. Players will see a list of their teammates and be able to chat with them in real time using Socket.io. 

- Allows users to login and register using secure authentication methods using bcrypt.js to encrypt passwords and store in a safe location. 

- Created with React, Redux, Node.js, NodeMailer, PostgreSQL, Socket.io, Axios.
