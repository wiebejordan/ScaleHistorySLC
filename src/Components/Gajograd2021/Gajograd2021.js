        The great city of Gajograd, located in Eastern Europe, is a strategic objective for both the Allies and the Axis, as it is a great supply center. Each side throws massive amounts of men and machine into the fray for control of the vital city and the surrounding rural area. 
        <br/>
        Gajograd is a Bolt Action event with an Axis vs Allies format. Players will register before the event for either side, and then create a force consisting of 800 points. Individual scores will be tracked, but each playerâ€™s combined scores will be totaled and one team will claim victory! 
        <br/>
        There will be 3 games, followed by prizes for the winning team, best Axis and best Allied general, and more!
